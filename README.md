# Advent-of-Code-2024

These are my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge. It's my first time doing this challenge but I'll still do my best to aim for all 50 stars!

I'll be using C++ in Visual Studio 2022. Expect nothing fancy, my goal is simply to reach the finish line the best I can :D

## Running and Debugging in Visual Studio
Each puzzle has its own project file. Be sure to right click a project and press "Set as startup project" so that the correct project is run with the solution you'd like to test.
Don't forget to change the path to the file containing the input you'd like to test.

Helper functions/classes that are used across puzzle projects, such as printing and Vector2 class, are found in the "HelperTools" project.
