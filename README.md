# Advent-of-Code-2024

This is my code for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge. It's my first time doing this challenge but I'll still do my best to aim for all 50 stars!

I'll be using C++ in Visual Studio 2022 and make the code easy to follow. Expect nothing fancy, my goal is simply to reach the finish line the best I can :D

## Running and Debugging in Visual Studio
Each puzzle has its own project file. Be sure to right click a project and press "Set as startup project" so that the correct project is run with the solution you'd like to run.
Don't forget to change the path to the file containing the input you'd like to test.

There are helper functions that are used across all puzzle projects, functions for printing and reading .txt files for example. These are found in the "HelperTools" project.
